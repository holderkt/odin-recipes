        <h3> Description</h3>
        <p> When I met my husband, he was not a big fan of vegetables, to say the least.  Over the years, I have learned that cooking veggies well makes all the difference.  These quick-roasted brussels sprouts are now one of his favorite foods.  He'll eat pounds at a time!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Brussels Sprouts</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Crushed Red Pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li>Slice the stem end off each Brussels Sprout, and then slice each one in half.  If any sprouts are significantly larger than the others, cut those into quarters.</li>
            <li>Pile the Brussels Sprouts onto a cookie sheet and add several tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Toss the sprouts until they have a thin coating of oil.  Add more olive oil if needed.</li>
            <li>Spread the sprouts out on the cookie sheet, cut sides down.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the sprouts generously with salt and pepper.  For a hint of spice, add a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast sprouts until they are darkly browned and the cut sides are crispy (approximately 30 minutes).  It is hard to really overcook these.  They taste great with some char!</li>
            <li>Taste the sprouts and add seasoning if necessary.  Don't be shy about adding more salt!</li>
        </ol>
